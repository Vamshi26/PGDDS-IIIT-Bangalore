# PGDDS-IIIT-Bangalore

This repository includes the projects that I am working on during my PG Diploma in Data Science. I've included the python scripts with detailed comments and pdf files for consolidated presentations wherever applicable. 

Please Note: If you are a current or future student of the PGDDS program offered by IIIT-Bangalore. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for clarifications. However, I strongly discourage you from integrating sections of the code for your submissions. Every submission is evaluated by a plagiarism checker and they have a very strict policy for plagiarism.

## Project Description:
